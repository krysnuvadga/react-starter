# React-Starter
Boiler-plate to help ne React developers get up and running in minutes
I have put together the core technologies needed installed to support Developing in React to create this boilerplate that 
allows you to launch new React Development servers in seconds.

### Usage
To get your very first ReactJS project up in an ideal configuration for developmen, all you need is:
1. clone or download the repository using `git clone https://github.com/krysnuvadga/react-starter.git`
2. Navigate into the starter directory using `cd starter` and Run  `npm i` OR `npm install`
3. Launch your development server by running `npm start`
